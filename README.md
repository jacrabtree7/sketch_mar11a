Name : Jacob Crabtree
 
Short Intro Sentence: This repository is to store the sketch for Arduino IDE used to familirize oursleves with the Guthub Desktop app.
 
Advantages: I think the Github Desktop app is very valuable because it allows files to be stored locally on a computer making for very easy file system organization as well as access. Another benefit of using Github is the collaboration aspect because it allows many individuals to work on a project while keeping track of all changes made, and even easily reverting them if needed.
